# Blog Post #6 : Show-Off

## Introduction

This blog post serves as the final one in the blog post series, serving as the final mentions about the game's development. Certain reflections about the game's completion are detailed in here.

## Conclusion for Dungeon Bonds

Looking at the [Game Design Document](/Blog%20Post%20#2%20Game%20Design%20Document.md) and the final version of the game, I can say that the scope has been narrowed throughout the development of this game. The final version of the game before the hand in managed to cover the main aspects of the intended game, while leaving room for addition in the future to cover the rest of the features.

### Final Version of Dungeon Bonds

In the end, Dungeon Bonds is an action-adventure game, setting the player in a dungeon setting with five levels to go through and complete. The player controls a character that needs to fight all regular enemies in the level, while trying to avoid death. Defeating all the regular enemies unlocks the boss fight, which further opens a portal to the next level. There is no map added to the game (for now), so while the player has limited vision to navigate through the dungeon levels, it allows him to explore and find all the rooms each level has to offer. Enemies are found around the rooms, patrolling and further engaging in fights with the player when they become aware of him. Although there are healing items placed around the levels, being attacked by multiple enemies at once, the player can find himself in a difficult situation, which might lead to the player's death. The game then offers the option to restart the level, or gamble for an extra chance, by flipping a coin. The outcome of this action can either restart the level or revive the player at 50% health points, ready to continue the adventure through the level. The levels created with procedural generating algorithms ensure that although rooms and corridors are generated randomly, they still follow a logic to not lead the player into places it might get stuck, which can lead to restarting the game.

### Future of Dungeon Bonds

Dungeon Bonds leaves room for additional features that could come in future updates. As the initial scope of the game was to include 2-player support, this can be a great first feature to be added in the near future of the game. The procedural generation of the levels can be further improved, to ensure each level is random, making it great for longer game sessions with friends. Additionally, the mechanics can be further improved and new weapons and powers could be added to ehance the gameplay experience.
