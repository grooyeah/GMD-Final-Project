# Blog Post #3 Dev Update 1

## Introduction

The aim of this blog post is to detail the development details on the GMD (Game Development) course's final project progress. This update includes details on the level creation and player's features such as the movement and the attack functionalities.

## Level Creation

For this final project, I was interested to try procedural generating levels. This aimed to be the basis of the game, as you could just progress through multiple levels, without having to spend much time on designing multiple game levels, but put more emphasis on the game logic and mechanics. I started by following a tutorial to set the grounds for the procedural generated levels, which can be found at this link [Procedural Generation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QOCX6SVFsk&list=PLcRSafycjWFenI87z7uZHFv6cUG2Tzu9v).

### Example of Generated Level

Following this tutorial, I was satisfied with the look of the levels generated by the algorithm ([LevelGenerationClass](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Scripts/LevelGeneration/RoomFirstLevelGenerator.cs)), and decided to not go further to fully implement it into the game, which would involve adding procedural generation for enemies and other objects that could be found in the level. I decided to grab five of the generated levels and turn them into prefabs inside Unity, which were used as the game's levels.

## Player Actions

For the player, I decided to create a funny looking character using Photoshop. Nothing too complicated, just a funny looking character. The two iterations of this process can be seen in the images of this section, and for the version to be used in the game, I went with the second one. Further, I went into Unity and created scripts for the player movement. This involved scripting a [PlayerController](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs) class for handling most of the actions that involve the player, such as movement and attacking. These were linked to the [InputActions](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Input/Input.inputactions) that were defined inside Unity's Input System. I have also attached a sword to the player, for melee attacks [MeleeAttackScript](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Scripts/Weapon/MeleeParent.cs) for handling the attacks. This involved also playing an animation, to mimic the sword swing when attacking.

Overall, the player game object has components attached to it such as BoxCollider2D, Rigidbody2D, the [PlayerController](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs) script and a [Health](../gmd-final-project/Assets/Scripts/Health/Health.cs) script for handling health in game, for both the player and the upcoming enemies.
